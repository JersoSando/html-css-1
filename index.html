        <h2>What Is It About</h2>
        <p>
            The Green Bone Saga is an adult fantasy series that takes an urban fantasy and mixes it with conflicts of a mafia family. 
            Jade is a substance that has the ability to grant people super human abilities. There's only two problems: not everyones 
            can handle jade and jade is extremely rare and is primarily found in the small island of Kekon. There are two families in 
            Kekon that control the Jade trade. They decide how much Jade goes out to other countries and who in Kekon gets to wear Jade. 
            So what happens when there's a new drug that allows everyone to be able to get Jade and outside military begins to get too
            powerful?

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            There has not been a fantasy series like the Green Bones in such a long time. Fonda Lee manages to create such an intricate 
            world with complex characters that has you cheering, crying, laughing, and scared within every book. The timeline for the series
            allows readers to experience the conflict from the very beginning and grow with each character to the very end. She does not spare the readers
            feelings and is somehow able to make you feel like you are part of the family. If you haven't picked up this series yet- I highly reccommend you do.
